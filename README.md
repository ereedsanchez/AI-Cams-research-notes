# AI Cams Research Notes
An (un)organized collection of research notes for research in AI Cameras with a specific focus on Animal Recognition.. 

### Synopsis
This repository documents a two-year CUNY Research Scholars Program (CRSP) project led by Prof. Edwin Reed-Sanchez that developed AI-powered wildlife monitoring systems in collaboration with Black Rock Forest. Building upon previous work establishing a WiFi mesh network for environmental sensing, the research team—including students Abdon Vizcarrando, Yangel Aguilera, Jorge Grullon, and Nagib Gonzalez—created solar-powered camera trap systems using ESP32-CAM microcontrollers, Wyze cameras, and Raspberry Pi platforms integrated with custom AI models for automated animal classification. The project progressed through multiple phases including electronics fundamentals, 3D design of weatherproof enclosures, hardware assembly, embedded programming, and machine learning integration using tools like Roboflow, YOLOv5/v8, and MegaDetector. The autonomous systems successfully tested at Bronx Community College and in Black Rock Forest. There has been significant progress in forest environments to detect and classify wildlife in real-time, demonstrating practical applications of affordable AI technology in ecological monitoring while providing students hands-on experience in solar power systems, embedded programming, computer vision, and conservation technology.

### Literature Review
- [AI-Forest-Cam-Literature-Review](https://github.com/ereedsanchez/AI-Forest-Cam-Litterature-Review/tree/main) - This initial literature review was conducted by MD, and Abdon Vizcorando

### Reports
- [Black Rock Forest Redden Grant Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15IkCpGMCDkm8erarC1mEj0kqz4jUdr_CKkKSLedYVns/edit?usp=sharing) - This project recieved additional funding from the Black Rock Forest Redden Grant in 2023.
  Here is the final report. It adequatly sumarizes project accomplishments.

### Documentation 
- [Forest-Buddy-Server](https://github.com/ereedsanchez/Forest-Buddy-Server) - Forest Buddy, was the first attempt at creating a functional server to intake images and use AI to process images.  This documentation has hardware and software specifications and instructions.  Includes installation of NVDIA, CUDU, Python, Tensorflow, etc..

- [AMB82-ForestBuddy](https://github.com/ereedsanchez/AMB82-ForestBuddy) - Arduino code repository for AMB82-Mini firmware.  The AMB82-Mini is the cameraboard of choice for low-cost, but high quality video for develppment of a complete AI Camera solution.
